# Monorepo Auto-Release

Background reading: https://dev.to/antongolub/the-chronicles-of-semantic-release-and-monorepos-5cfc




Extends `monorepo-semantic-release` to have full `semantic-release` tooling



Example monorepo that has the following:

- yarn workspaces w/ lerna
- typescript with
  - umd, commonjs and esm output
  - jasmine tests, running in browsers and node
  - eslint for typescript
- typedoc with
  - markdown page support
  - custom handling of external module naming
- [conventional commits](https:#www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) tooling, including
  - husky for commit hooks
  - commit linting to ensure consistentcy
  - commitizen to make it easy (`yarn c`)
- Use [Semantic Pull Requests](https:#github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests) to ensure PR has at least one semantic commit
- travis-ci tooling for
  - automated, semantic-releases
  - probot to ensure PR's have at least one semantic commit before allowing merge

## Commits
Commit messages must follow the conventional commit format:

```
type(scope?): message
```
Type must be one of `[build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test]`

Scope is optional, but if you put in the `( )`'s then the scope must be a valid package name. Multiple packages can be separated by commas

Breaking changes are denoted with a `!` before the `:`

You can use the command line or tooling to create commits, as long as they follow this format. If they do not, you will recieve an error, and the commit will not be processed.

*Note* Although you could use `--no verify`, unless you have at least one commit that follows this convention, your PR will be blocked from merging.


`git commit` Examples:

```sh
$ git commit -m 'docs: add new section to guide'
# type: docs, scope: omitted
# When merged to master, no release will happen, but docs will be deployed

$ git commit -m 'fix(package-a, package-b): update the flux inverter'
# type: fix, scope: package-a and package-b
# When merged to master, a PATCH release will happen, docs will be deployed

$ git commit -m 'feat(package-b): add houston adapter'
# type: feat, scope: package-b
# When merged to master, a MINOR release will happen, docs will be deployed

$ git commit -m 'fix(package-a)!: fix the greet function and require an additional parameter'
# type: fix, scope: package-a, ! means a breaking change, and the message
# When merged to master, a MAJOR release will happen, docs will be deployed
```

Or you can use `yarn c` which will walk you through the same information using [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)
